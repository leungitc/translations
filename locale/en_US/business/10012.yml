  site-description_10012: '10012-Our story began in Adelaide, on one of the historical
    streets of the city. We are a group of people who love people, and passion of
    hospitality service and most important is we all love the Thai Street Food. Fresh
    and so tasty!!


    We love our chilli and we understand how frustrating it can be to have the wrong
    chilli hit in your meal!


    We know how important it is to have the right level of heat for every customer
    so most of our meals are graded.


    No chilli → mild → medium hot → transitional hot → extremely hot → Freakin'' Hot!fffffff


    At S2; our dream is to create a place anyone can love. A place for people to relax
    and chill withhhhh friends and family. Moreover, we want people to have experiences
    they will remember.


    A place that makes you feel welcome and at home. We use all the freshest herbs,
    vegetables, and have an open kitchen for you to have look while we areh cooking
    your food.


    We know nowadays people have busier lives than ever before. So we''ve created
    a place for you and your friends or family to come to relax and enjoy fresh Thai
    food. We will take care of the rest. Not just that, we know some of the people
    don’t even have time to come out for a 12 dining experience, if you still want
    to enjoy our amazing Thai food at home; you can find us on Uber Eats and of course
    you''re more than welcome to call us for your delivery or pick up order. This
    is a modification!'
